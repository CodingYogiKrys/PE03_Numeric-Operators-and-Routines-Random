PE03: Numeric Operators and Routines, Random
Exercise 1. Create a new C# Console project called ExpressionsTest 
Declare an integer variable named ‘a’ initialized to the value 100, and another integer variable named ‘b’ initialized to the value 20.
Output the result of the expression “a plus b” using the following code example:
   	  Console.WriteLine("{0} + {1} = {2}", a, b, a + b);
Create four more WriteLine statements using the following numeric operators: subtract, multiply, divide, remainder. Change the operator in both the string and the expression.

Exercise 2. Create a new C# Console project called BinaryOperatorsTest 
Declare an integer variable named ‘a’ initialized to the value 100, and another integer variable named ‘b’ initialized to the value 20.
Output the value of ‘a’ following the expression “assign ‘a plus b’ to a” using the following code example:
   a += b;
   Console.WriteLine("The value of a is now:{0}", a);
Create four more binary operator statements that modify variable ‘a’ using the following numeric operators: subtract, multiply, divide, remainder. 
Repeat the WriteLine statement after each change to display the new value of variable ‘a’.

Exercise 3. Create a new C# Console project called RandomTest 
Repeat the steps in Exercise 1, replacing the hard-coded values 20 and 100 with two randomly generated values between 1 and 100.
Run the program multiple times and verify the variable values are randomly generated.
